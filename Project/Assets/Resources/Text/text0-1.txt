Well......another New Year......
I dislike New Year......I even hate it, maybe. It annoyed me really.
So much people...... are wasting their time......
Wasting their time on gathering, eating, drinking, and being annoying......
Why can't they be more productive? Be more quiet?
A really outstanding person should be a......productive and quiet one.
I have been keeping believe that for half of life.
Well, seems that I have find my earplug, and keep on working......
Knock,Knock,Knock
