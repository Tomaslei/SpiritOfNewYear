# SpiritOfNewYear
Basically, our project aim at building the interactable and gamified environment that illustrates the scene of a culture activity—— lunar new year diner, the very time for all chinese in which friends and family gathering together and prepare for a good dinner.
Basically, player need to constantly keep the fire level at the assigned level. After player surpass one level, the game has its mechanism automatically move to next level. The game reach to its end after player overcoming all three levels.
The challenge of this game is that not only player has to control fire by “blowing”, but also he or she has to keep the level of “blowing” corresponding to three fire levels in the game. 
In the further design, our team may add the fail component in order to create more dynamics in the difficult level. Also, we may add quality and score system to strengthen feedbacks of the game. The quality of the dish depends on the performance of players. The better they control the fire, the better dishes will be. And finally, families will score players according to  the quality of the dish.
This is how our interaction work:
